# RISC-V CPU (WIP)

This is a custom design of a CPU based on RISC-V. The design implements the RV32I base instruction set using the Harvard architecture.
The CPU is a 5-stage pipelined processor with the stages: 

Fetch
- The Fetch stage contains the instruction memory and the program counter. The instruction memory stores instructions for the system to complete, and the program counter simply keeps track of which instruction to work on at the current moment.

Decode
- The Decode stage contains the instruction decoder, register file (RF), jump branch logic (JBL), and data hazard mitigation logic (DHML).
- The instruction decoder generates the control signals for the datapath. The RF stores recent data. The JBL looks at the current instruction to determine if it is a jump instruction or branch instruction, and to take it or not. The DHML looks at the current and previous two instructions to determine if there is a data hazard. If action is required it freezes pipeline stages and/or forwards data.

Execute
- The Execute stage contains the arithmetic logic unit (ALU).
- The ALU computes arithmetic and bitwise logic operations.

Memory Access
- The Memory Access stage contains the data memory.
- The data memory stores specific data from the register file, and loads data from the data memory to the RF

Writeback
- The Writeback stage contains a mux to the register file.
- The mux in the Writeback stage determines which data to pass into the RF.

Currently, the initial design is complete. The project is now in the simulation phase.
